# Climate Wavers - AI Model

Welcome to the AI-Driven Disaster Response Project - Climate Wavers! This project leverages TensorFlow to integrate climate and earthquake datasets, empowering our disaster response system with accurate predictions and proactive insights. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you understand and contribute to this project.

##  **Project Overview:**
This project integrates historical climate and earthquake data to build a robust AI model for disaster prediction and response. By utilizing TensorFlow, we create advanced machine learning algorithms that enable real-time analysis and forecasting.

##  **Data Set Integration:**
- **Climate Data:**
  - Historical temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns are integrated for climate analysis.
- **Earthquake Data:**
  - Earthquake magnitude, location, depth, and occurrence time are incorporated for seismic analysis.
- **TensorFlow Integration:**
  - TensorFlow is utilized to merge and preprocess the integrated datasets efficiently.


## Preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy

### Loading the Dataset
We start by loading our climate and earthquake dataset into Pandas DataFrames.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load your dataset into Pandas DataFrames
climate_data = pd.read_csv('climate_data.json')
earthquake_data = pd.read_csv('earthquake_data.json')
```

### Data Preprocessing
We preprocess the data to prepare it for model training. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating feature matrices and target arrays.

```python
# Data preprocessing steps (replace with your specific preprocessing steps)
# Handling missing values
climate_data.fillna(0, inplace=True)
earthquake_data.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Feature selection and encoding (if needed)
features = pd.concat([climate_data[['temperature', 'precipitation']], earthquake_data[['magnitude', 'depth']]], axis=1)
labels = earthquake_data['disaster_type']

# Encoding categorical variables (if applicable)
# (e.g., using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn)
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)
```

## Building the Prediction Model with Scikit-Learn

### Splitting the Data
We split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Model Training and Evaluation
We use scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms for model training and evaluation.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Initialize and train the model (Random Forest Classifier a good starting point due to its robustness
and ability to handle a variety of data types)
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```
