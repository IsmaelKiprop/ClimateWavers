# Climate Wavers- Node.js Server

The Node.js Server component of the Climate Change and Disaster Response Platform is designed to handle real-time data acquisition from third-party sources using WebSockets. This server acts as a bridge between external datasets and the AI models, providing a seamless and efficient way to integrate real-time information into the platform.

## Project Overview

The Climate Change and Disaster Response Platform aims to monitor climate changes, predict natural disasters, and facilitate efficient disaster response. The Node.js Server, powered by WebSocket technology, enables the platform to gather real-time data from various sources, enhancing the accuracy and timeliness of predictions.

## Features

- **WebSocket Integration:** Establishes WebSocket connections to receive real-time data streams.
- **External API Integration:** Communicates with third-party APIs to acquire diverse datasets.
- **Data Processing:** Processes incoming data and prepares it for consumption by AI models.
- **Scalability:** Designed for scalability, allowing seamless integration of multiple data sources.
- **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling mechanisms for data retrieval failures.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nodejs-server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Define the following environment variables in the `.env` file:
     ```env
     PORT=3000
     THIRD_PARTY_API_URL=<third-party-api-url>
     ```

4. **Run the Node.js Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The Node.js server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## WebSocket Endpoints

- **Data Acquisition:**
  - `/data-stream`: WebSocket endpoint to establish a connection for real-time data acquisition.
  
## Environment Variables

- **PORT:** Port number for the Node.js server (default: `3000`).
- **THIRD_PARTY_API_URL:** URL of the third-party API providing real-time data.

## External API Integration

The Node.js server integrates with external APIs to acquire real-time datasets. Ensure that the API endpoints are accessible and provide data in a format compatible with the server's processing logic.

## Error Handling

The server includes error handling mechanisms to manage scenarios where data retrieval from external sources fails. Error logs and notifications are implemented to aid in diagnosing and resolving issues promptly.
